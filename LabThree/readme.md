# Lab 3 - Snort

In this lab assignment, you will get familiar with the network intrusion detection system of Snort. 

The goals of this lab include:
1.	To get you acquainted with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)
2.	To use the IDS to detect attacks
3.	To study IDS logs
4.	To create and study IDS rules


## Setup

- Go to http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/lab_env.html to install the pre-built VM image (Ubuntu 16.04 32 bits).
- VM setup instruction (in Virtualbox): this manual also contains account information (usernames and passowrds) https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/Documents/SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf

In this lab, you need to have three VMs under the same local network. Note that these three VMs should be in the promiscuous mode in order to listen to traffics from other VMs. Once you have configured a VM, you can simply clone that VM for two more times to complete the VM setup. Please refer to Appendix A and B of the VM setup instruction.
